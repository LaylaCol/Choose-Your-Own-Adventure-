# Choose-Your-Own-Adventure-
This project is a choose your own adventure game. A choose your own adventure game is where you make a series of choices which lead to different outcomes. These have been around for the long time in the form of books and eventually in video games. What makes these games engaging and interesting is the fact that no one is going to have the same story or the same adventure so it encourages replayablity to find out different paths. There is a huge sense of discovery that you can't find in any other gaming experience. The greatest example of these types of games is by a company called Telltale games. They are responsible for games such as Telltale's The Walking Dead and Tales from the Borderlands. I hope to spark the same wonder and excitement with my game.
This project will be worked on by 2 contributors. Their roles are specified in the roadmap.
